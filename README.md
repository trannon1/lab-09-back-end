**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is to create a website that uses google map apis to create an app that simulates a map. This will allow the user to search for a location and find the name, state, location, and even weather.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Create a github repo.
2. Create a ReadMe and .env file.
3. Create a git.ignore file that avoids pushing files with sensitive information.
4. Create a package.json file via npm init, which creates a package and limits your app to specific dependecies and versions of said dependencies so it will never fail if it encounters a newer version of the dependency.
5. Deploy app to Heroku.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This app uses cors, express, and dotenv as dependencies. The language used for code is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

12/10/2019 10:44am - Application has been deployed to Heroku
12/10/2019 11:10am - Functionality added to server.js for location search
12/10/2019 11:46am - Functionality added to server.js for weather forecast
